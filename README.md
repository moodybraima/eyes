# eyes

## Description

In this app, a pair of eyes can track the movements of the mouse. The codes allow the eyes to track the coordinates of the mouse in the screen of the computer.

## How to Run

Place the mouse anywhere within the window of your device. Move the mouse around the pair of eyes, move the mouse closer or away from the eyes, or up and down the window and the eyeballs will always follow the movements of the mouse.
